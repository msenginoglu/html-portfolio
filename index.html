    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      After taking part in short-term jobs/projects from different sectors since
      2017, I decided to continue my career as a front end web developer as of
      April 2023. I aim to improve my web development skills by taking a
      professional course in June 2023. I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript
      as I want to specialize in the front-end field. Popular frameworks are
      also among the topics I plan to learn. I strive to keep myself up to date
      and follow new technologies in the field of web development.
